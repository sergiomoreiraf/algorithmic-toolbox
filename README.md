# algorithms

Source code for Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization.

This is only a boilerplate with the first challenge avaiable.

Fist run **npm install**.

To run one challenge with debug enabled, on root folder type

```sh
node --inspect <file to run.js>
```

To test everything with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), run

```sh
npm test
```

If you want to debug during test, run

```sh
npm run test:debug
```

I recomend use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for edit and run files.
